        <h1> Analysis </h1>
        <p>   The following charts show analyses for the Heart Disease (18 & Over) 2011-2012 and Los Angeles Index of Change datasets in isolation. This is so we can establish extraordinary neighborhoods as well as other relationships or trends to keep in mind when comparing these datasets with the locations noted in the Cigarette and Tobacco Retailers dataset.</p>
        <p>   The first two charts depict the same proportion of heart diagnoses found in the Heart Disease (18 & Over) 2011-2012 dataset two ways. First by establishing a boxplot of the percent of diagnoses in each neighborhood. In the second chart, we take this percent and break it down, plotting the number of diagnoses against the population in each neighborhood. We can see which neighborhoods have a high percent of diagnoses as they will appear above the linear cluster or a low percent of diagnoses as they will appear below the linear cluster.</p>
        <p>   The next three charts take the six measurements used to calculate the Index Score (an aggregate created to measure level of gentrification) and compare them against one another to show unexpected trends and notable neighborhoods. Repeatedly, we saw that West Adams (zip code 90014) was the plot to look out for. The last chart shows the distribution of Index Scores. While there were no low outliers, there were a handful of high outliers indicating high levels of gentrification from the year 2000 to 2014 in select neighborhoods.</p>
