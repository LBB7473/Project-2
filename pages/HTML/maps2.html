          <p>We used the data taken from the USC Neighborhood Data for Social Change to create a Choropleth Map of Los Angeles County zip-codes, with marker clusters of tobacco retailer shops. The zip-code colors indicate a red tone if the index of change is high, and a blue tone if the index of change is low or non-existent. In looking at the map, it appears as though the largest concentration of change is near downtown Los Angeles. That part of the map also contains the largest concentration of tobacco retailers. Gas stations, liquor stores, and smoke shops are largely present in lower income areas, so it would seem likely that there would be lots of tobacco retailers in areas that are becoming gentrified. Furthermore, the wealthiest areas of Los Angeles, namely Beverly Hills, Bel Air, Westwood and Pacific Palisades, have a very small index of change and additionally have a very small concentration of tobacco retailers. An interesting area to look at is a small neighborhood called Canoga Park that is nestled in between Calabasas and Woodland hills. The area has had a large amount of gentrification in comparison to the surrounding areas and subsequently has a larger concentration of tobacco retailers comparatively. Bel Air has the smallest tracked index of change with 0.141 whereas downtown LA has an index of change of 0.814. Additionally, Bel Air has three identified tobacco retailers and downtown LA has 118 and is nearly 1/10th in size.</p>
