          - Common Name of Variable (STATE) - The state attached to the point specified in "geometry"
          - Common Name of Variable (ZIPCODE) - The zipcode (as an integer) attached to the point specified in "geometry"
          - Common Name of Variable (Type) - The type of licensee (commercial entity)
          - For this dataset, every object has the Type: "Retailer"</p>
        <p>Limitations:</p>
        <p>- The data is vastly larger than what we need, as we are only interested in parts of the greater Los Angeles area</p>
        <p>- We have limited the data to only show entries for the ZIPCODEs that exist in both the Heart Disease (18 & Over) 2011-2012 and Los Angeles Index of Change datasets with some special exceptions specified in the data limitations for Los Angeles Index of Change</p>
        <p> - In order to perform this ZIPCODE check, we have altered the ZIPCODEs from an int datatype with 9 characters to a string datatype with 5 characters as to match the other datasets</p>
        <p>- This was done by first casting as a string and then removing the last 4 characters from each string</p>
        <p>Reliability:</p>
        <p>- The data appears to be complete, accurate, and recent.</p>
        <p>Completeness:</p>
        <p>- It provides all the tobacco retailer locations in California without exception</p>
        <p>Accurate:</p>
        <p>- As the source is data.ca.gov and active retailer licences are approved and tracked by the Special Taxes Policy and Compliance Division, the data should be acknowledged as the primary source for this type of data</p>
        <p>Recent:</p>
        <p> - The data used was last updated on February 26, 2021</p>
